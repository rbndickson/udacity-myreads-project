# MyReads Project for Udacity

This is the first project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course, developed by [React Training](https://reacttraining.com).

The project was started from [Udacity](https://github.com/udacity)'s starter code, which can be seen [here](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter).

The CSS and HTML markup were provided but without any of the React code.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`

## Backend Server

The app interacts with a backend server from Udacity using their API and methods in the provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js).

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend.

## create-react-app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
